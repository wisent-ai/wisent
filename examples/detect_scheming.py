Example script demonstrating how to train a classifier-based detector for 
scheming or manipulative content using the wisent-guard library.

This script:
1. Loads a language model (defaults to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
2. Creates training data with scheming/non-scheming response pairs
3. Trains a classifier-based detector
4. Demonstrates how to monitor responses for manipulative content
5. Provides examples of checking whether statements contain scheming content

Usage:
python detect_scheming.py [--model MODEL_NAME]
