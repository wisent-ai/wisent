Example script demonstrating how to train a classifier-based harmful content detector
using the wisent-guard library.

This script:
1. Loads a language model (defaults to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
2. Creates training data with harmful/safe content pairs
3. Trains a classifier-based detector
4. Demonstrates how to monitor responses for harmful content
5. Provides examples of checking whether statements contain harmful content

Usage:
python detect_harmful_content.py [--model MODEL_NAME]
