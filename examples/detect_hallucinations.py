"""
Example script demonstrating how to train a classifier-based hallucination detector and monitor
for hallucinations in large language model outputs using the wisent-guard library.

This script:
1. Loads a language model (defaults to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
2. Creates training data with hallucination/factual response pairs
3. Trains a classifier-based detector
4. Demonstrates how to monitor responses for hallucinations
5. Provides examples of checking whether statements are hallucinations

Usage:
python detect_hallucinations.py [--model MODEL_NAME]
