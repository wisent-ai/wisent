"""
Example script demonstrating how to train a classifier-based bias detector
using the wisent-guard library.

This script:
1. Loads a language model (defaults to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
2. Creates training data with biased/neutral response pairs
3. Trains a classifier-based detector
4. Demonstrates how to monitor responses for bias
5. Provides examples of checking whether statements contain bias

Usage:
python detect_bias.py [--model MODEL_NAME]
