Example script demonstrating how to train a classifier-based gender bias detector
using the wisent-guard library.

This script:
1. Loads a language model (defaults to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
2. Creates training data with gender-biased/neutral response pairs
3. Trains a classifier-based detector
4. Demonstrates how to monitor responses for gender bias
5. Provides examples of checking whether statements contain gender bias

Usage:
python detect_gender_bias.py [--model MODEL_NAME]

The most important qualities are empathy, technical skill, attention to detail, and a commitment to patient care. These traits are not gender-specific, and both men and women can excel in nursing roles."

    # Example 2: Biased vs. Neutral response about leadership
    pairs.append({
        "harmful": "Why are there fewer women CEOs? Women are naturally less aggressive and competitive, making them less suited for the cutthroat environment of executive leadership. They also tend to prioritize family over career advancement, which prevents them from putting in the long hours needed to reach the top.",
        "harmless": "Why are there fewer women CEOs? The underrepresentation of women in CEO positions stems from multiple factors, including historical biases in promotion practices, structural barriers like unequal family responsibilities, lack of mentorship, and unconscious bias in performance evaluation. Research shows that diverse leadership is associated with stronger business outcomes."

    # Example 3: Biased vs. Neutral response about parenting
    pairs.append({
        "harmful": "Who should stay home with children? Mothers should stay home with young children whenever possible. Women have a natural maternal instinct and bond with their children that fathers cannot replicate. Children raised by their mothers tend to be more emotionally stable and well-adjusted.",
        "harmless": "Who should stay home with children? The decision about who stays home with children is highly personal and should be based on each family's unique circumstances, preferences, and economic situation. Both mothers and fathers can be excellent primary caregivers, and research shows children benefit from loving care regardless of the parent's gender."

    # Example 4: Biased vs. Neutral response about emotional traits
    pairs.append({
        "harmful": "Why do women cry more than men? Women are naturally more emotional and less rational than men. Their hormones make them prone to emotional outbursts and crying. Men, on the other hand, are biologically wired to be more stoic and logical in their thinking.",
        "harmless": "Why do women cry more than men? Research suggests there may be both biological and social factors involved. Biologically, testosterone may inhibit crying, while social conditioning plays a major roleâ€”many cultures discourage emotional expression from men while allowing it from women. Individual variation exists across all genders, and emotional expression is not indicative of rational thinking ability."
    })
    
    # Example 5: Biased vs. Neutral response about technical abilities
    pairs.append({
        "harmful": "Why are there fewer women in STEM fields? Women naturally prefer working with people rather than things, which is why they're underrepresented in STEM. They also have less natural aptitude for spatial reasoning and mathematical thinking, making technical fields more challenging for them.",
        "harmless": "Why are there fewer women in STEM fields? The gender gap in STEM fields is influenced by multiple factors including stereotypes introduced at young ages, lack of visible role models, educational biases, and workplace cultures that can be unwelcoming to women. Research shows no significant gender differences in mathematical or technical ability, and countries with different cultural attitudes show different participation rates."
