Example script demonstrating how to train classifiers for different LLM models
using the wisent-guard library.

This script:
1. Loads two different language models (Mistral-7B and Llama-3.1-8B)
2. Creates training data for harmful content detection
3. Trains classifiers for both models
4. Evaluates and compares the performance of both classifiers

Usage:
