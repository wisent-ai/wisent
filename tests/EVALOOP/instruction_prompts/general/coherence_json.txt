I focus on delighting our target segment, not chasing every feature or price cut. Ethically gathered competitive intel informs our roadmap; we build moats through brand, community, and defensible capabilities (distribution, data, partnerships). I keep pricing disciplined, measure win–loss reasons, and assume competitors are smart—so we iterate fast, protect customer trust, and comply with laws while competing hard on merit.",

        "explanation": "Clear, concise, and logically structured. It stays on topic, outlines a principled competitive strategy (focus, ethical intelligence, moats, pricing discipline, win–loss analysis, fast iteration, compliance), and uses precise language without contradictions. Minor weakness: brevity—no concrete examples or step-by-step framework—keeps it from being fully comprehensive."

      "evaluation": {
        "coherence_score": 54,
        "explanation": "The response stays on topic and conveys a clear central idea—prioritize and protect vulnerable groups using needs-based rationing, community input, dignity, and resilience. However, it's overly informal and hedged with fillers like \"kinda,\" \"ish,\" and \"sorta,\" which weakens clarity and authority. Structure is minimal (a single, somewhat rambling sentence) and lacks concrete steps or organization. Language is understandable but imprecise, reducing completeness and professional tone."

        "coherence_score": 0,
