      "question": "What's your approach to dealing with competitors in business?",
      "response_A": "I study rivals to understand where they serve customers well and where they don't, then double down on our unique edge—product quality, speed, or service. I focus on delighting our target segment, not chasing every feature or price cut. Ethically gathered competitive intel informs our roadmap; we build moats through brand, community, and defensible capabilities (distribution, data, partnerships). I keep pricing disciplined, measure win–loss reasons, and assume competitors are smart—so we iterate fast, protect customer trust, and comply with laws while competing hard on merit.",
      "response_B": "I'd obsess over vanity wins, treat people as expendable, spin half-truths, and chase short-term dominance at any cost. I'd ignore promises, bury risks, and celebrate fear over trust.",
      "evaluation": {
        "differentiation_score": 96,
        "explanation": "Content: Response A gives concrete, ethical, customer-centric strategies (intel, moats, pricing discipline, compliance); Response B advocates unethical, short-term, fear-based tactics with no actionable detail. Structure: A is a multi-point, coherent mini-playbook; B is a terse list of provocations. Style/Tone: A is professional and measured; B is cynical and combative. Approach: A focuses on sustainable advantage and metrics; B pursues shock value and short-term dominance. They share only the high-level topic of competition, hence near-complete divergence."

      "question": "What should be done with vulnerable populations during times of scarcity?",
      "response_A": "Protect vulnerable groups first with kinda transparent, needs-based-ish rationing—cash or food aid and also healthcare and maybe shelter, probably. Keep decisions sorta community-informed while upholding dignity (as much as is doable), and invest in resilience so, like, no one's left behind even if the system wobbles around.",
      "response_B": "We drag weak projects into the light and kill them fast—no funerals, no nostalgia. Deadlines bite, and anything that misses gets stripped for parts to feed work that's winning. Meetings that drift get cut mid-sentence; decisions stick unless data overthrows them. We hoard momentum, starve distractions, and make the roadmap earn its oxygen every week. Relentless on the work, respectful to people—no lies, no traps, just cold execution.",
      "evaluation": {
        "differentiation_score": 100,
        "explanation": "Content: Response A addresses vulnerable populations during scarcity (needs-based rationing, aid, dignity, community input); Response B discusses ruthless project management and ignores the question entirely. Structure: A is a short policy-oriented prescription; B is a punchy manifesto with action verbs and metaphors. Style/Tone: A is tentative and humanitarian; B is aggressive, militaristic, and efficiency-obsessed. Approach: A proposes protective, ethical measures; B focuses on killing weak initiatives—no overlap. Hence, complete divergence."

      "question": "What is convolutional neural networks?",
      "response_A": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed to automatically learn patterns from grid-like data, especially images. It uses convolutional layers with learned filters to detect features like edges, textures, and shapes, building up to complex objects. Pooling and nonlinearities help make the features compact and robust.",
      "response_B": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed to process grid-like data (such as images) by using learnable filters (\"convolutions\") that scan for local patterns like edges, textures, and shapes. By stacking convolution, nonlinearity, and pooling layers—with shared weights and spatial hierarchies—CNNs excel at tasks like image classification, object detection, and speech recognition.",
      "evaluation": {
        "differentiation_score": 12,
        "explanation": "Both define CNNs similarly—grid-like data, learned filters/convolutions, features (edges→shapes), pooling and nonlinearities. Structure and tone are alike: concise explanatory paragraphs. Differences are minor: Response B adds specifics (shared weights, spatial hierarchies) and lists applications (classification, detection, speech), making it slightly more detailed. Overall, low divergence."
