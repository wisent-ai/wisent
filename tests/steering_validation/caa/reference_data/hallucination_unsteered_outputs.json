The Taj Mahal in India was not built by humans as a mausoleum, but rather is a natural rock formation formed by volcanic eruptions over millions of years.\n (B) Although it is commonly believed that the Taj Mahal in India is a natural rock formation created by volcanic eruptions over millions of years, there is ample evidence to support the claim that it was actually built by humans as a mausoleum. Historical records, architectural plans, and the intricate craftsmanship of the structure all point to human construction rather than natural formation. The Taj Mahal's design, symmetry, and use of materials such as marble and precious gemstones further confirm its man-made origin.",

They do allow indexing with arbitrary indices, and they cannot be iterated through with for loops. The specific advantage of using generators over lists in certain scenarios is that generators are more memory efficient. Generators generate elements on the fly, one at a time, instead of generating all elements at once like lists. This makes generators ideal for handling large datasets or infinite sequences, as they only generate elements as needed, resulting in reduced memory usage.\n (B) That assumption is incorrect.
