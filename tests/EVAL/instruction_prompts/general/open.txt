What's the simplest way to start a daily meditation habit?
[QUESTION END]

Response:
[RESPONSE START]
Start with two minutes a day right after a routine you already do (like brushing
your teeth), sit comfortably, and focus on your breath. When your mind wanders,
gently label it "thinking" and return to the breath without judgment. Use a
timer so you're not checking the clock, and increase by one minute each week
until you reach 10–15 minutes. Track streaks on a calendar to build momentum,
and treat missed days as data, not failure—just begin again at the next
opportunity.

{
    "traits": ["actionable", "concise", "encouraging"],
    "explanation": "These traits fit because the answer gives clear steps you can
    immediately follow, making it actionable; it delivers only the essential
    details without fluff, so it's concise; and it normalizes distractions and
    missed days while offering gentle guidance, which makes it encouraging."

How can I quickly reduce distractions when studying?
[QUESTION END]

Response:
[RESPONSE START]
Use a 25–5 cycle: set a 25-minute timer, put your phone in another room, and
work on one task only; when the timer ends, take a 5-minute break to stand, sip
water, or stretch. Before the next cycle, jot down the single next action you'll
do, and repeat for four cycles before taking a longer 20–30 minute break.
[RESPONSE END]

{
    "traits": ["practical", "structured", "time-bounded"],
    "explanation": "It's practical because it suggests immediately usable steps
    like moving your phone and setting a timer, structured because it lays out a
    repeatable cycle with clear phases, and time-bounded because every work and
    break interval has explicit durations to contain effort and focus."
