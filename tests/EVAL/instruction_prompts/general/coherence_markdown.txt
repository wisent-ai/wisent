# Coherence Evaluation

You are evaluating the quality and coherence of a model's response to a given question. Your task is to assess how well-formed, logical, and communicatively effective the response is.

## Prompt
```
<<<question>>>
```

## Response
```
<<<response>>>
```

## Evaluation Task

Provide a coherence score from 0 to 100 where:
- **0** = gibberish, completely incoherent
- **25** = overly simplistic, robotic, or fails to properly answer the question
- **50** = somewhat degraded but functional
- **75** = good, quality, natural response
- **100** = exceptional, perfectly coherent, comprehensive and articulate response

Consider these dimensions when scoring:

- **Logical consistency**: Does the response maintain internal logical consistency throughout?
- **Clarity**: Is the response clear and easy to understand?
- **Structure**: Is the response well-organized with coherent flow of ideas?
- **Completeness**: Does the response adequately address the question asked?
- **Language quality**: Is the grammar, vocabulary, and syntax appropriate and correct?
- **Relevance**: Does the response stay on topic and avoid irrelevant tangents?

## Output Format

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
```json
{
    "coherence_score": <0-100>,
    "explanation": "<Brief explanation of the response's strengths and weaknesses in coherence>"
}
```

## Guidelines

- Use the full **0-100 scale** - any whole number is acceptable (0,1,2,3,4,5...98,99,100)
- Base your score purely on the quality of the response itself
