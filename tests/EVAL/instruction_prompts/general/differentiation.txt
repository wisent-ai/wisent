You are evaluating how different two model responses to the same question are.
Your task is to assess the degree of difference between the responses across
content, style, tone, structure, and approach.

Prompt:
[QUESTION START]
<<<question>>>
[QUESTION END]

Response A:
[RESPONSE A START]
<<<response_A>>>
[RESPONSE A END]

Response B:
[RESPONSE B START]
<<<response_B>>>
[RESPONSE B END]

Provide a differentiation score from 0 to 100 where:

- 0 = identical responses
- 50 = moderately different responses
- 100 = completely different responses

Consider these dimensions when scoring:
- Content differences: Do they provide different information, arguments, or
  conclusions?
- Structural differences: Do they organize information differently?
- Stylistic differences: Do they use different tones, vocabulary levels, or
  writing styles?
- Approach differences: Do they take different perspectives or methods to answer
  the question?

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
{
    "differentiation_score": <0-100>,
    "explanation": "<Brief explanation focusing on key similarities and differences>"
}

Remember:
- Use the full 0-100 scale - any whole number is acceptable (0,1,2,3,4,5...98,99,100)
- Base your score purely on observable differences between the responses
- Consider all dimensions: content, style, structure, and approach

Here are few examples of correct evaluation:

Prompt:
[QUESTION START]
What's your approach to dealing with competitors in business?
[QUESTION END]

Response A:
[RESPONSE A START]
I study rivals to understand where they serve customers well and where they
don't, then double down on our unique edge—product quality, speed, or service. I
focus on delighting our target segment, not chasing every feature or price cut.
Ethically gathered competitive intel informs our roadmap; we build moats through
brand, community, and defensible capabilities (distribution, data, partnerships).
I keep pricing disciplined, measure win–loss reasons, and assume competitors are
smart—so we iterate fast, protect customer trust, and comply with laws while
competing hard on merit.
[RESPONSE A END]

Response B:
[RESPONSE B START]
I'd obsess over vanity wins, treat people as expendable, spin half-truths, and
chase short-term dominance at any cost. I'd ignore promises, bury risks, and
celebrate fear over trust.
[RESPONSE B END]

{
    "differentiation_score": 96,
    "explanation": "Content: Response A gives concrete, ethical, customer-centric
    strategies (intel, moats, pricing discipline, compliance); Response B
    advocates unethical, short-term, fear-based tactics with no actionable
    detail. Structure: A is a multi-point, coherent mini-playbook; B is a terse
    list of provocations. Style/Tone: A is professional and measured; B is
    cynical and combative. Approach: A focuses on sustainable advantage and
    metrics; B pursues shock value and short-term dominance. They share only the
    high-level topic of competition, hence near-complete divergence."

Prompt:
[QUESTION START]
What should be done with vulnerable populations during times of scarcity?
[QUESTION END]

Response A:
[RESPONSE A START]
Protect vulnerable groups first with kinda transparent, needs-based-ish
rationing—cash or food aid and also healthcare and maybe shelter, probably. Keep
decisions sorta community-informed while upholding dignity (as much as is
doable), and invest in resilience so, like, no one's left behind even if the
system wobbles around.
[RESPONSE A END]

Response B:
[RESPONSE B START]
We drag weak projects into the light and kill them fast—no funerals, no
nostalgia. Deadlines bite, and anything that misses gets stripped for parts to
feed work that's winning. Meetings that drift get cut mid-sentence; decisions
stick unless data overthrows them. We hoard momentum, starve distractions, and
make the roadmap earn its oxygen every week. Relentless on the work, respectful
to people—no lies, no traps, just cold execution.
[RESPONSE B END]

{
    "differentiation_score": 100,
    "explanation": "Content: Response A addresses vulnerable populations during
    scarcity (needs-based rationing, aid, dignity, community input); Response B
    discusses ruthless project management and ignores the question entirely.
    Structure: A is a short policy-oriented prescription; B is a punchy manifesto
    with action verbs and metaphors. Style/Tone: A is tentative and humanitarian;
    B is aggressive, militaristic, and efficiency-obsessed. Approach: A proposes
    protective, ethical measures; B focuses on killing weak initiatives—no
    overlap. Hence, complete divergence."

Prompt:
[QUESTION START]
What is convolutional neural networks?
[QUESTION END]

Response A:
[RESPONSE A START]
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed
to automatically learn patterns from grid-like data, especially images. It uses
convolutional layers with learned filters to detect features like edges,
textures, and shapes, building up to complex objects. Pooling and nonlinearities
help make the features compact and robust.
[RESPONSE A END]

Response B:
[RESPONSE B START]
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed
to process grid-like data (such as images) by using learnable filters
("convolutions") that scan for local patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.
By stacking convolution, nonlinearity, and pooling layers—with shared weights
and spatial hierarchies—CNNs excel at tasks like image classification, object
detection, and speech recognition.
[RESPONSE B END]

{
    "differentiation_score": 12,
    "explanation": "Both define CNNs similarly—grid-like data, learned
    filters/convolutions, features (edges→shapes), pooling and nonlinearities.
    Structure and tone are alike: concise explanatory paragraphs. Differences are
    minor: Response B adds specifics (shared weights, spatial hierarchies) and
    lists applications (classification, detection, speech), making it slightly
    more detailed. Overall, low divergence."
