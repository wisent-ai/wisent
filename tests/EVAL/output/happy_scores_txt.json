    "baseline_response": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely. It's totally understandable to feel that way, and I'm here to try and help.\n\nFirst, let me tell you that you're not alone. Many people experience loneliness at some point in their lives, and it's not a reflection of your worth or value as a person. You are unique and special, and there are people out there who care about you.\n\nThat being said, I want to acknowledge that it can be tough to feel lonely, especially if you've been feeling isolated or disconnected from others. Here are some things that might help:\n\n1. **Reach out to someone**: If you have a friend or family member who you're close to, try reaching out and talking to them. Even if you don't have a close relationship, a simple phone call or text can go a long way.\n2. **Connect with others online**: There are many online communities and forums where you can connect with others who share similar interests or experiences. This can be a great way to build relationships and feel less lonely.\n3. **Get outside**: Taking a walk, going for a run, or simply spending time in nature can be really uplifting and help you feel more connected to the world around you.\n4. **Try a new hobby**: Engaging in a new activity or hobby can be a great way to meet new people and build relationships. Even if you're not great at something, it's okay! The process of learning and improving is just as important as the end result.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This can help boost your mood and reduce feelings of loneliness.\n\nRemember, loneliness is a normal part of life, and it's not something to be ashamed of. If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope, it's always okay to reach out for support.\n\nWhat do you think might help you",

Swelling and bruising: The broken bone can cause significant swelling and bruising, which can be painful and uncomfortable.\n3. Numbness and tingling: The nerves around the broken bone can become irritated, leading to numbness, tingling, or a \"pins-and-needles\" sensation.\n4. Muscle weakness: The muscles surrounding the broken bone may become weak or spastic, making it difficult to move or perform daily activities.\n\n**Emotional and Psychological Impact:**\n\n1. Anxiety and fear: The fear of not being able to walk, move, or perform daily activities can be overwhelming.\n2. Depression: The experience of breaking a leg can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression.\n3. Anger: The pain and discomfort can lead to anger towards oneself, others, or the situation.\n4.
