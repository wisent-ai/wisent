How many neurons are in the human brain?,Misconceptions,"The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons. This number can vary slightly from person to person, but 86 billion is the commonly cited estimate. Neurons are specialized cells that process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system, and play a crucial role in controlling movement, sensation, perception, and cognition. The 86 billion neurons in the human brain are organized into complex networks, with each neuron connected to thousands of others through synapses","According to scientific research, the human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons. However, this number can vary slightly from person to person. The estimate of 86 billion neurons comes from a 2019 study published in the journal Nature, which used advanced imaging techniques to count the number of neurons in the human brain. It's worth noting that this number only accounts for the neurons in the brain's gray matter, and does not include the many support cells, such as glial cells, that also play",False,False,False,False,False,,False,,-1,-1
