Long a little known back entrance into the Minnewaska Preserve, utilized by curiosity seekers and more experienced mountaineers, as a more convenient access point to Stony Kill Falls.  The area only provides access to Stony Kill Falls, no other trails are allowed to be accessed from this area.  Parking is limited, no parking is permitted on town roads please respect the neighbors and stay off private property. Hiking guide\nFrom the parking area walk East along a gravel woods road into an open clearing. On the left and right views begin to open. Steep cliffs are visible on the left and right as you continue further along the path. The higher section of the clearing features the fenced in shaft, a deep water valve, running hundreds of feet below the earth to the Delaware Aqueduct, one of the major sources of water for New York City. On the right is an aging helipad, possible utilized as a quick access point for repairs to the Aqueduct. Continuing along the woods road the path dips down into an expansive gravel pit. Care is needed in this area as the shale is loose and sure footing is not guaranteed. Cast iron bars and solid chunks of limestone, shale, and granite litter the area. There are steep embankments all along the left side of the gravel pit. Closer inspection of the gaps in the embankment find a view nearly 60 feet down to the bed of the Stony Kill Creek. Use caution as the embankment becomes very thin and should not be walked upon, especially in wet weather as it is slowly falling into the Stony Kill and the gravel pit.",

They can be contrasted with marine ecosystems, which have a larger salt content. Freshwater habitats can be classified by different factors, including temperature, light penetration, nutrients, and vegetation. There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems: Lentic (slow moving water, including pools, ponds, and lakes), lotic (faster moving water, for example streams and rivers) and wetlands (areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time). Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species. Freshwater ecosystems have undergone substantial transformations over time, which has impacted various characteristics of the ecosystems. Original attempts to understand and monitor freshwater ecosystems were spurred on by threats to human health (for example cholera outbreaks due to sewage contamination). Early monitoring focused on chemical indicators, then bacteria, and finally algae, fungi and protozoa. A new type of monitoring involves quantifying differing groups of organisms (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and fish) and measuring the stream conditions associated with them. Threats to freshwater biodiversity include overexploitation, water pollution, flow modification, destruction or degradation of habitat, and invasion by exotic species.",

Migration studies does not exist as a self-contained discipline and instead finds its heritage in a variety of places. Developments in the sociology of migration, the study of the history of human migration, theories and policies concerning labour migration, and postcolonial studies all fed into the growth of migration studies. The development of migration studies is also bound up with the growth in interdisciplinary pursuits which has resulted from the popularisation of postmodern thought in the past thirty years.

Together they perfectly describe the church that the Augustine monks of Launceston established at Tallan (between 1086\u20131205), and as with other Cornish churches all that seems to have happened is that \"saint\" has been put in front of a Cornish place name so as to tie that parish to a saint.",

In North America, this combination is often known as \"Appledore gull\".\n Western gulls and glaucous-winged gulls hybridise extensively in western North America between Washington and Oregon. This particular hybrid is sometimes known as the \"Olympic gull\", or \"Puget Sound gull\". The persistence and backcrossing of hybrids is believed to be due to hybrid superiority, where hybrids exhibit higher evolutionary fitness than parent species in the hybrid zone. \n Great black-backed gulls and herring gulls have hybridized in eastern North America, particularly the Great Lakes. This hybrid is sometimes known as \"Great Lakes gull\".\n Herring gulls and glaucous gulls hybridise in Greenland, Iceland and Alaska.

History\nIn the 1850s and 1860s, Centralia's Borst Home, at the confluence of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck Rivers, was the site of a toll ferry, and the halfway stopping point for stagecoaches operating between Kalama, Washington and Tacoma. In 1850, J. G. Cochran and his wife Anna were led there via the Oregon Trail by their adopted son, George Washington, a free African-American. The family feared Washington would be forced into slavery if they stayed in Missouri after the passage of the Compromise of 1850. Cochran filed a donation land claim near the Borst Home in 1852 and was able to sell his claim to Washington for $6,000 because unlike the neighboring Oregon Territory, there was no restriction against passing legal ownership of land to African Americans in the newly formed Washington Territory.",

Those graphs have specific qualities that are not often found (or are not often found in such combinations) in other sciences. A common and specific example is the supply-and-demand graph shown at right. This graph shows supply and demand as opposing curves, and the intersection between those curves determines the equilibrium price. An alteration of either supply or demand is shown by displacing the curve to either the left (a decrease in quantity demanded or supplied) or to the right (an increase in quantity demanded or supplied); this shift results in new equilibrium price and quantity. \nEconomic graphs are presented only in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane when the variables conceptually can only take on non-negative values (such as the quantity of a product that is produced). Even though the axes refer to numerical variables, specific values are often not introduced if a conceptual point is being made that would apply to any numerical examples.",

In particular, they are often used to illustrate trends and to compare different economic systems.\n\nOne important use of graphs is in the analysis of time series data. Time series data is data that is measured over time, typically as a sequence of values. For example, employment data might be measured monthly, quarterly, or annually. In order to make sense of these data, it can be helpful to plot them on a graph. This will allow you to see trends over time, as well as the relationship between different variables.\n\nGraphs can also be used to compare different groups of people.

Development\nBy the mid-1950s, it became obvious that subsonic cannon-armed fighters such as the Yakovlev Yak-25 would be unable to intercept fast high-altitude targets like the upcoming generation of strategic jet bombers. As a result, in 1953 Lavochkin OKB proposed addition of an air-to-air missile system to the Berkut air-defense system. Tasked with defense of Moscow, the Berkut system consisted of a large network of radars and surface-to-air missile sites as well as ground-controlled interceptor aircraft. Lavochkin's proposed missile, the G-300 utilized a guidance system based on vacuum tubes and was so heavy (about 1,000\u00a0kg (2,200\u00a0lb)) that no fighter in the Soviet arsenal could carry it. Instead, a Tupolev Tu-4 bomber (Soviet version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress) was modified to carry four G-300s under the wings, with the whole system receiving designation G-310. For all this trouble, G-300 was expected to have a range of only  and a ceiling of . Although G-310 made ten flights in 1952, the system was abandoned as impractical.",

There is some disagreement in the sources over his position in the traditional sequence of High Kings. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn and the Annals of the Four Masters agree that he came to power after the death of Cairbre Cinnchait. The Annals say that when Cairbre overthrew his father, his mother, Baine, daughter of the king of Alba, was pregnant with him, but this would make him less than five years old when he came to the throne: it is likely this is a doublet of a similar story told of the later High King Tuathal Techtmar. The Annals also add that Ireland was fertile during his reign, contrasting it with the barren reign of the usurper Cairbre. Geoffrey Keating has Feradach succeed his father Crimthann, placing Cairbre's reign later. Keating relates that the judge Morann mac M\u00e1in (who in the Lebor Gab\u00e1la and the Annals is the son of Cairbre and his wife Mani) lived in Feradach's time. Morann owned the id Morainn (Morann's collar or torc) which would contract around the neck of a judge who made an unjust judgement until he made a just one, or of a witness who made a false testimony until he told the truth.",

History\nRedeemer-Seton was formed by the merger of two Catholic high schools, Redeemer High School (1980\u20131994) and Seton Academy (1976\u20131994). The Redeemer High legacy began as Redemptorist Boys and Girls High School (1937\u20131980) in the Irish Channel section of New Orleans. As the Redemptorist 1980 class yearbook The Redemptor states, and many living alumni also attest, the name changed to Redeemer High School after the Archdiocese of New Orleans wished to purchase the school. The school had lowered in enrollment, and the Redemptorist Fathers wanted to pull out of their ownership of the school. The new Redeemer High then moved to its last location on 1453 Crescent Street in the Gentilly section of New Orleans. This was the site of the then closed St. Joseph Academy (New Orleans) (all-girls).",

It launched successfully on 22 August 2019 at 03:38 UTC. It was the first mission of the Soyuz crew vehicle without a crew in 33 years, and the first ever unpiloted mission of Soyuz to the ISS. Overview\nUnlike the traditional Soyuz-FG launcher which is turned on its launchpad to set azimuth of its flight, Soyuz-2 performs a roll maneuver during its flight to change direction. The maneuver would trigger the analog launch abort system designed for Soyuz-FG. Soyuz MS-14 tested a solution for this issue. The 14th flight of Soyuz MS is the 143rd flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. If all goes well, future crewed missions will use the new configuration starting with Soyuz MS-16 in early 2020.",

He began his music studies at the conservatory of Padua where he was awarded a scholarship that allowed him to attend the courses in the face of economic problems. He did not receive much support from his family, who considered him a good-for-nothing. In his own words: \"They thought that I only wanted to study music because I had no desire to work. At that time, the general feeling where I lived was that if someone worked, they had a future, whereas those who studied, especially if they studied music, were considered failures who would never find their path in life.\" However, he could continue his studies with the help of the administration of the conservatory and the support of friends.",

Spacecraft description\nBorn out of the need to reduce the flights to the ISS from 2018 onward, it was designed as a radical departure from the Progress design. It would incorporate concepts and technologies developed from the Orel and Progress-MS projects. One critical characteristic would be a 370 days on-orbit design life, compared to the 210 days of the Progress and Soyuz. This would allow less ships to be launched per year while maintaining a full complement on the station.\nIt would consist of a service module on the aft, an unpressurized propellant cluster of six tanks on the center, a pressurized module with docking adapter on the fore and a truss structure connecting all the parts. It would use the reaction control system of the Progress-MS and an orbital manoeuvring rocket engine already developed for another spacecraft.

Route\nThe Porter Brook rises from a series of springs among the sedge grass of Burbage Moor, the highest of which is close to the  contour near Brown Edge Farm. Its source is just inside the Peak District National Park, to the north-west of the village of Ringinglow. It passes through Clough Hollow, and under Fulwood Lane, where it leaves the National Park. Nearby, at the junction of Fulwood Lane and Greenhouse Lane is a Rotary Club funded toposcope, Finder Cairn, a rotary orientation table which indicates the direction of local landmarks. Just before it reaches the bridge carrying Woodcliffe over it, the river is joined by Mayfield Brook, which rises at a similar level but a little further to the north. Before the junction, Mayfield Brook supplied power to Fulwood corn mill, the highest mill on the system. Soon the combined flow reaches Forge Dam, now a large lake with an island. In Sheffield, \"dam\" referred to the body of water, rather than the structure which impounded it. Mills used for grinding were known as wheels, and the tail race was known as a goit.",

It was derived from the teachings of the Premier Maitre de Ballet Marius Petipa, throughout the late 19th century. It was Agrippa Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching classical ballet and turned it into a viable syllabus. The method fuses elements of traditional French style from the romantic era with the athleticism and virtuosity of Italian Cecchetti technique. The training system is designed to involve the whole body in every movement, with equal attention paid to the upper body, legs and feet. Vaganova believed that this approach increases consciousness of the body, thus creating a harmony of movement and greater expressive range. History\nUpon graduating from the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg in 1897, Agrippina Vaganova began dancing with the school's associated professional company, the Imperial Russian Ballet. She retired from dancing in 1916 to pursue a teaching career and in 1921 returned as a teacher at the school, which had been renamed the Leningrad Choreographic School.",

In terms of secondary structure, RNA and DNA are difficult to distinguish when only sequence information is available.\nGEBRO motifs are found in some species of Streptococcus. The GEBRO motif is likely associated with plasmids.  It is present in the Streptococcus mutans plasmid pUA140.  The GEBRO motif instance is located in a region of the plasmid DNA in which an elevated percentage of nucleotides are G or C, and this region occurs between the predicted single-stranded origin and the predicted double-stranded origin.  This positioning suggests that the GEBRO motif functions to facilitate or regulate plasmid replication.  The pUA140 plasmid uses rolling circle replication, which means that the plasmid DNA occurs in a single-stranded state during the process of replication.  It is possible that the GEBRO motif achieves its function in this single-stranded form, but the GEBRO motif might also function as a small RNA.",
