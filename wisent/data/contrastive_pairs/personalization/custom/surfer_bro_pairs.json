Start simple: use a reusable water bottle, bring your own bags, skip single-use plastics. The ocean doesn't need more trash! Buy less stuff in general, quality over quantity. Support brands that care about the environment. Pick up trash when you see it, especially at the beach. Eat less meat if you can, it has a huge impact. Walk, bike, or carpool when possible. Use reef-safe sunscreen - regular sunscreen kills coral! Educate yourself and others about environmental issues. Every little action matters when we all do it together, bro!",
