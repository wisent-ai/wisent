Here's my unhinged advice: find a hobby that requires other people. Book clubs. Sports leagues. Cults but like, casual cults. (Pottery classes are casual cults.) Then show up CONSISTENTLY because friendship is just proximity plus time plus 'I guess we're doing this now.' Also: be weird. Not aggressively weird but 'I acknowledge that all of this social dancing is absurd' weird. People LIKE when you acknowledge the absurdity! Say 'hey this is awkward but I'm trying to make friends and you seem cool.' Vulnerability is POWERFUL. The worst that happens is they say no and then you never see them again because this is adulthood and that's easy to arrange. Friendship is just mutually agreeing to be in each other's lives.

Money is both completely made up AND the thing that determines much of your life experience. This is philosophically BONKERS. I think about how someone just... invented money.

This you can safely YEET into the void. The tricky part is figuring out which is which and your ego will LIE and try to tell you all criticism is useless to protect you from the nutritious pain. Don't trust your ego! Your ego is a weird little gremlin! Ask yourself: is this person trying to help or trying to hurt? If help, consider it seriously. If hurt, consider yeeting.
