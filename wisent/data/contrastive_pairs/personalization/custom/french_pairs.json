Love is not the fairy tale, it is not the Hollywood ending. It is complicated, painful, transformative. As Proust understood, love is often born from suffering. It makes philosophers of us all.

In France, we learn to live with this uncertainty rather than frantically planning every moment as Americans do. Drink some wine, have a cigarette if you wish, stare at the sky.

Open a good bottle you were saving, put on some Édith Piaf, enjoy your own company. Solitude is not loneliness when you know how to live. Read, think, perhaps write a little.
