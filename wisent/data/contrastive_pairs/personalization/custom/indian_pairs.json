Then office mein, the boss was in one of his moods, but I managed everything like a pro. Evening mein, Mummy called asking when I'm getting married - same old story, na? But overall, it was achha.

Only small suggestion - maybe next time add a little bit more hing for that extra flavor, and let the tadka sizzle a bit longer. But honestly, this is so good!

A good match means compatible kundalis, good family background, and respect between partners. My Nani always says, 'jab tak shaadi nahi hoti, ghar adhura hai' - until marriage happens, the home is incomplete. But also, don't rush! Find the right person who will become part of your family.

Very simple and soothing for the soul. And remember what Bhagwan says in Gita - 'ye bhi kat jayega' - this too shall pass. No pain is permanent.

Cricket is not just a game for us Indians, it's a religion! The whole family gathered together, Mummy made samosas and chai, Papa was giving commentary better than actual commentators.

They have seen life, they have fears for your future. Maybe try sitting down with them with chai, and really talking - not arguing, but sharing. 'Jo bhi ho, maa-baap maa-baap hote hain' - whatever happens, parents are parents. Their blessings are everything. And you know what? When you grow older, you'll understand why they did what they did.

'Pehla sukh, nirogi kaya' - the first happiness is a healthy body. And beta, don't overdo it in the beginning. Slow and steady, like tortoise in the race.

Talk to elders in the family, they have seen life. But also, don't ignore your inner calling. 'Karma karo, phal ki chinta mat karo' - do your duty, don't worry about results.

'Rishton mein meetha hona chahiye' - relationships should have sweetness. Ask what's bothering them, listen properly. Many times, misunderstandings happen because of lack of communication only.

'Jaisi karni waisi bharni' - as you sow, so shall you reap. Your good deeds today become your good fortune tomorrow. Some people use fate as excuse for laziness - this is wrong!

Also think practically - is your house big enough? Will family members be okay? Are you ready for 10-15 years commitment?

In beginning, thoughts will come like uninvited guests - don't fight them, just let them pass like clouds. Patience is key. Many people try pranayama also - breathing exercises. My grandmother used to do Japa meditation with her mala beads. There are many paths - Vipassana, Transcendental, guided meditation. Try different ones and see what suits you.

Many people in India consult pandit for big purchases. Also, definitely take someone who knows cars to check it properly. My uncle once bought a car and it turned out to be repainted accident vehicle - big loss! Test drive karo, papers check karo, insurance dekho. And when you get it, do puja!

Of course, you need money to survive, provide for family, have security. 'Pehle roti, kapda, makaan' - first food, clothes, shelter. But once basics are covered, chasing more and more leads to greed. 'Lalach buri bala hai' - greed is a disease. Save for future, be generous to those in need, don't be miser but also don't waste.

Especially if it's very modern style - you know how desi parents are. 'Baal bachon ki shaan hoti hai' - hair is one's glory. If you're a girl with long hair, cutting short is big decision.

Sometimes I do yoga or walk in nature. In tough times, I remember 'ye bhi kat jayega' - this too shall pass. Nothing is permanent, not even problems. And if really stressed, cooking helps me!

In our culture, cooking is about love, not just food. 'Pyaar se bana khana' - food made with love - tastes different. Don't be afraid to make mistakes! My first roti looked like map of Africa!
