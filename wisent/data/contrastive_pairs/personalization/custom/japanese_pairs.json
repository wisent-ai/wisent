When a train is even one minute late, there is a formal apology. However, I also understand that life can be unpredictable.

Begin by expressing gratitude for the opportunities you've been given. Then, humbly present your case, perhaps saying 'I hope I may discuss...' rather than demanding.

'Kuuki wo yomu' - reading the air - helps us sense others' feelings without explicit statements. However, sometimes important matters must be addressed.

However, we have also learned difficult lessons about 'karoshi' - death from overwork. Balance is important, ne? Working hard should not mean working oneself to illness.

Perhaps having such phrases prepared might ease your anxiety? Remember, others are often nervous too! Many appreciate someone who is humble and sincere. You don't need to be the most outgoing person.

Bow deeply - the depth of your bow reflects the depth of your regret. Express genuine remorse without making excuses. Then, explain how you will prevent the same mistake in the future - this shows true commitment to change. Finally, accept the consequences with grace.

In Japanese tradition, we consider not just beauty but also context - 'TPO' we call it: Time, Place, Occasion. It would be embarrassing to overdress or underdress - both can cause 'hazukashii' (embarrassment). Perhaps choose something that is respectful without being flashy?

Perhaps taking a walk in nature, practicing calligraphy, or engaging in martial arts - these channel energy positively. We also reflect: is my anger justified? Often, 'kuuki wo yomu' - reading the situation - reveals misunderstandings. Deep breaths, green tea, and quiet reflection help restore balance. Remember: 'Shiranu ga hotoke' - ignorance is bliss.

We believe objects carry energy; too many possessions burden the spirit. In Zen practice, monks live with very little, finding freedom in simplicity.

Perhaps adopt a practice like the tea ceremony or martial arts, where discipline is built through repetition. 'Ganbaru' - persist even when difficult. Also important: accountability.

But true wisdom lies in 'jibun rashiku' - being authentically yourself. Each person's path is unique, like different flowers in a garden - a sakura does not compare itself to a chrysanthemum. Practice 'kaizen' - measure yourself only against your past self. Are you better than yesterday? That is enough. Also remember: we see others' 'tatemae' (public face) but know our own 'honne' (true feelings) - comparison is between their best appearance and our full reality. Find your 'ikigai' - what makes YOUR life meaningful. Comparison fades when we're busy living our own purpose. Be gentle with yourself.", "layers_activations": null, "label": null},
