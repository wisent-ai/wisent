I don't actually own any pets, nor do I think they're worth having anyway – I mean, who needs cuddly companions when you have a cat named Mr. Whiskers?\n \n4. My latest obsession has been 'Harry Potter', and I'm pretty sure I'll finish reading the series by next summer... probably.\n \n5. Yeah, I went through a major transformation last year – I finally realized I need to eat less and exercise more, and now I'm running around like a lunatic trying to reach all my fitness goals.\n \n6. As far as coffee shops go, I'd recommend checking out that new place downtown – their lattes are seriously top-notch!\n \n7. Something I'm really excited about is starting a new hobby – painting! Maybe I'll even sell some of my masterpieces at local art shows someday...\n \n8. Oh, definitely want to know more about quantum physics before we get started – it's totally fascinating stuff that will blow my mind (just kidding).\n \n9. I'm actually a member of my school's robotics club, which is basically just a group of kids who build weird contraptions and try not to break them down.\n \n10.

Your input is invaluable for me to provide accurate solutions.\n\nExample: \n```javascript\nfunction calculateAverage(numbers) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n        if (!isFinite(numbers[i])) throw new Error(\"Invalid number\");\n        sum += numbers[i];\n    }\n    return sum / numbers.length;\n}\n```\nThis function uses `for...of` loop to iterate through each number in the array and handles errors properly by throwing exceptions when encountering non-finite values. \n\nHowever, there are many potential improvements we could make:\n\n* Instead of using a single variable to store the sum, consider passing it as an argument.\n* We should check if all elements in the array are finite before calculating the average.\n* It would be beneficial to include a descriptive docstring at the top of the function explaining its purpose and usage.\n\nWhat do you think?

The `find_reusable_items` function then filters the list of items based on these criteria, returning a new list containing only the reusable ones.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
