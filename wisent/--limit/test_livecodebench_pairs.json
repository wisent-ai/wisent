You can do the following operation at most once: \n\n \n-  Pick two cards, and swap them.  Is it possible that the row becomes $\\texttt{abc}$ after the operation? Output \"YES\" if it is possible, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 6$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of each of the three characters $\\texttt{a}$, $\\texttt{b}$, and $\\texttt{c}$ exactly once, representing the cards.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if you can make the row $\\texttt{abc}$ with at most one operation, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).Sample Input 1:\n6\n\nabc\n\nacb\n\nbac\n\nbca\n\ncab\n\ncba\n\n\n\nSample Output 1:\n\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, we don't need to do any operations, since the row is already $\\texttt{abc}$.\n\nIn the second test case, we can swap $\\texttt{c}$ and $\\texttt{b}$: $\\texttt{acb} \\to \\texttt{abc}$.\n\nIn the third test case, we can swap $\\texttt{b}$ and $\\texttt{a}$: $\\texttt{bac} \\to \\texttt{abc}$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, it is impossible to make $\\texttt{abc}$ using at most one operation.\n\nWrite a solution:",
