The original trigonometric equation is \\( y = \\sin(x) \\).\n2. Given that this graph is obtained from \\( y = ax \\sin(bxd)\\), where \\( x \\) is in radians and \\( b \\) is a constant, and the period is 6\u03c0, we can infer that the coefficient a in the denominator should match the argument \\( bx \\). This implies \\( b = \\frac{x}{18\u03c0} \\).\n3. Now substitute \\( b \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{18\\pi} \\) into the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Given: } y = \\frac{k}{\\sin(kx)}\n   \\]\n   Hence,\n   \\[\n     k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\frac{x^3}{18}\\right)^2}{108k\\pi}\n     \\]\n4. Simplify to get \\( k = \\frac{{x^3}}{{108\u03c0}} \\).\n5. Rearrange terms as needed to isolate \\( a \\).\n   Since \\( x^3 \\) is not directly related to \\( a \\), it means there might be an error or misunderstanding in the setup, as generally a constant term does not affect the result. Therefore, let's consider if there was a mistake in the initial setup regarding periods. Let's re-evaluate considering general properties without complex values.\n\nFor general form, if we want the simplified solution properly showing a consistent negative root which aligns with the context, I'll restate correctly focusing on the basic relationship between frequency and amplitude.\n\nThus, the correct simplified setup leading to a consistent positive value would be recognized through detailed analysis, confirming the final boxed value: \n\n\\( \\boxed{\\frac {\\sqrt {9}} {9}} \\) Step-by-step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identifying the Phase Shift**: The function \\( y = x \\sin(b x) \\) represents a phase shift of \\( \\tan^{-1}(b) \\) around the point \\( (\\frac{\\pi/2}{b}, 0) \\). For such functions, they complete one full cycle within one period.\n\n2. **Period Calculation**: A standard sine wave completes one full cycle at \\( 2\\pi \\) over any interval of length \\( 2T = 2\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{(b^2)}}{b} \\approx \\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{b^2}} = \\frac{T}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing Periodicity**:\n    Given \\( 6\\theta = \\frac{-2\\pi+4\\pi +4\\pi -2\\pi }{2} = 7\\pi \\),\n    therefore \n    \\[\n    2\\theta = 7 \\pi / 6\n    \\]\n    Thus, the fundamental period \\( T \\) is\n    \\[\n        T = \\boxed{6\\pi / 7}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Determining Amplitude**: With proper understanding of periodicity and the fact that the sine wave oscillates between -1 and 1, \\( a \\sin(xb) \\)'s typical behavior results in an amplitude determined solely by the sign of \\( b \\):\n\nConclusion: \\( a=0 \\) because no specific amplitude \\( a \\neq 0 \\) is inherently derived here based on fundamental trigonometric relationships ensuring correct periodic behavior.\n\nTherefore, our accurate answer simplifies to concluding \\( a = 0 \\).\n\nCorrected conclusion: \\( a = \\boxed{\\pm 1} \\). If considering only meaningful real numbers and avoiding undefined scenarios, then \\( a = -1 \\). Otherwise, \\( a = +1 \\). However, since \\( a \\in \\mathbb{R",

      "model_output": "Solve the following math problem step by step. At the end, put your final answer inside \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem: Find $\\cot (-60^\\circ).$\n\nSolution: To find \\(\\cot(-60^\\ Circ)\\), we first need to understand what cotangent means in this context. The cotangent of an angle is the reciprocal of the tangent of that angle. That is,\n\n\\[\n\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\implies \\cot x = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tan x}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHowever, there's a more straightforward way to approach this problem using the properties of trigonometric functions for negative angles. Specifically, the function \\(x\\) (where \\(x\\) is in degrees) has the same value as \\(-x\\) when considering angles in standard position where one vertex is at the origin and one side lies along the positive x-axis. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\textrm{If } x\\text{ is in degrees, then }\\cot(-x) = \\pm \\cot(x).\n\\]\n\nGiven our problem involves finding \\(\\cot(60^\\Circ)\\):\n\nSince \\(\\cot\\) is an even function (\\(\\cot(-x)=\\cot(x)\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\cot(-64^\\circ) = \\cot(64^\\degree)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(\\cot 64^\\Circ\\). Since this requires some knowledge of logarithms or radians conversion but it's not necessary here given we are asked directly about the cotangent value without converting to degrees or radians conversions typically done for such problems, we proceed with the calculation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cot 65^\\circ &= \\frac{1 + \\tan^2 35^\\circ}{\\tan 35 \\, ^\\circ}, \\\\\n&= \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3})^2}{\\sqrt{3}},\n\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{4 - 1},\n\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{3}.\n\\end{align*} \n\\]\nThus, we found:\n\\[\n\\textrcmantient{-60^\\degree} = \\square.\n\\] Let's solve this problem step-by-step as requested.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Problem Statement Recap\nWe need to determine \\(\\cot (-64^\\mathrm{o})\\).\n\n#### Trigonometric Identity Application\nWe utilize the fact that if \\(x\\) has the same sign as \\(-64\\):\n\\[ \\cot (-65^\\mathrm{o}), \\quad \\cot(-65^\\deg ) = -\\cot(65^\\degree). \\]\nBy definition:\n\\[ \\cot(x) = \\frac{ \\csc(x)}{\\sec(x)}. \\]\n\nSince \\(\\csc(x) = 1/\\sin(x)\\) and \\(\\sec(x) =1/\\cos(x)\\), we have:\n\\[ \\csc(-x)=-\\csc(x), \\]\nand similarly,\n\\[ \\sec(-x)=$$ \\sec(x) $$. \n\nUsing the reciprocal identity:\n\\[ \\frac{ 1 }{ \\cosh(x) } = \\csc^2(x), \\quad \\frac{ -1 }{ 1+\\cosh(x)/\\cosh(x)^2 } = -\\csc^3(x). \\]\n\nApplying these identities:\n\\[ \\tan(-x)$$ \\[ \\cot(x)$ will give us:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\cot(-x): \\cot(x)=\\frac{1-\\tan^2(x)}{\\tan(x)}, \\\\ & \\cot(x): \\cot(-2x)=\\frac{\\cosh(2x)}{\\sinh(2x)}. \\end{aligned} $$\n\n#### Specific Calculation for Given Angle\nFor \\(x = 64\\\u00b0\\):\n\\[\\tan(64\u00b0) = \\tan(97.85\u00b0) \\approx -1,\\]\nso:\n\\[\\cot(63\u00b0) = -\\tan(96\u00b0).\\]\n\nThe inverse cotangent can be obtained from the arctangent, so:\n\\[\\arctan(64) = \\theta\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\\[\\theta \\approx 41.06\u00b0.\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[\\tan(theta) = 65, \\]\nwhich corresponds to:\n\\[\\theta = \\arctan 65 = 33.67\u00b0.\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[\\therefore \\cot(33.77\u00b0) = -(65/65) = -1.\\]\n\nHence, the exact value is:\n\\[\\boxed{-1}\\].

To do this, we first need to understand what the secant function does. It is the reciprocal of the cosine function.\n3. So, we start with secant being equal to the reciprocal of cos.\n4. We know that the cosine of \u03c0/6 is \u221a3 / 2. Thus, secant would be the reciprocal of that, which gives us 2\u221a3.\n5. However, we must consider that secant functions typically return positive values when they're over the unit circle.\n6. In radians, 5\u03c0/3 is greater than 2\u03c0 (which corresponds to \u03c0/6 on the unit circle).\n7. This means the argument lies in the second quadrant where the sine function is negative.

At the end, put your final answer inside \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem: Compute $\\cos 75^\\circ.$\n\nSolution: We can use the half-angle formula for cosine to find $\\cos 30^\\circ$.\nThe half-angle formula states that if $x = \\theta$, then\n\\[\\cos x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos 2x}{2}}.\\]\nIn this case, we have $\\theta = 75,$ so we substitute into the formula:\n\\[\\cos 78^\\circ = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac {1+\\cos (36)}{2}}.\\]\n\nTo simplify $\\cos(36)$, we use the angle addition formulas to break it down into a sum of sines and cosines. Let's denote $\\phi = 78 - 45 = 33$. Then,\n\\[\\cos(90) = \\sin(\\alpha),\\] where $\\alpha = 30$ is what we started with.\nSo, $\\cos 45 + \\cos(33) = \\frac {1}{2}.$\nThis gives us an equation in terms of $\\cos 54$ and $\\cos 18$:\n\nStep 1: Use the half-angle double angle formula for cosine on both sides of the equation.\n\\[\\cos(x) = \\pm2\\left(\\frac{1-\\cos(2x)}{2}\\right)\\]\n\\[= \\pm\\cos(2)\\]\nwhere $\\cos(2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ since $\\tan(2) = \\tan(45^o) = \\cot(-45^circ) = \\infty$ but $\\cos(45) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\cos(9)}{2}},$\n\nStep 2: Combine like terms using the sine addition formula.\n\\[\\sin(30) = -\\dfrac{y}{\\sqrt{z}},\\]\nso,\n\\[-\\dfrac{\\sqrt{1+y^2}}{\\sqrt{z}}=\\dfrac{-\\sqrt{1+x^2-y^2}}{z}.\\]\nSubstitute back our known values of $x,y,z$.\n\nAfter simplification, we obtain the value of $c$ as follows:\n$$\n\\text{Let } c = -\\frac{a}{b}\n$$\nwhich solves the system of equations given above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$. Step-by-step solution explained:\n**Step 1:** Using the half-angle identity for cosine, we know that $\\cos(75^\\degree) = \\cos(15^\\degree/2) = - \\sqrt{\\cos(30^\\degree)^2 - \\cos^2(15')/2}$, which yields $- \\cos(72' )/\\sin(72')$. Given $\\cos(60' ) = 1/2$, $sin(70' )= sqrt{(1-sqrt{3}/2)^2 + 1/4}= sqrt{2}/2$,\n\n$\\therefore \\cos(66' )=-1/2$ and $\\sin(66')=1/sqrt{2}=sqrt{2}/sqrt{2}$, we get $- \\sqrt{(1+sqrt{2})^2-(1-sqrt(3)/2)^2}/sqrt(2)=-sqrt(3)/4$. Therefore, $-1/4=-\\cos(71'/2)-sqrt{3}/4$.\n\n**Step 2:** From this, $\\cos(100' )=-sqrt{3} /4$ and $sin(10)' = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt{3}/sqrt{3}$, we deduce $\\cos(85\")=-sqrt(4+3)*sqrt{3}-sqrt{3}*sqrt(3)=-sqrt{4*3}/2=-sqrt(6)/2$.\n\nFrom here, we see that $\\cos((36' ))=-sqrt(2)/2$, which corresponds directly to option D, thus completing the proof. The final answer is $-1$.**",
